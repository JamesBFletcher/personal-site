        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I have experience in python and java, object oriented programming, system design, and collaborative projects, as well as some experience in other languages (C#, scheme, SQL, HTML, CSS). Most importantly, I am excited and willing
          to learn new things and further develop my skills as a programmer and software engineer.</p>

        <h3>Product and Customer Development</h3>
        <p>While interning for a startup, I co-ran customer development interviews and presentations to succeed in the National Science Foundation's I-Corps program, advacing the company onto nationals and securing an initial $50,000 in NSF funding. At the same time, I built software prototypes in order to test and develop the startup's product.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>I have a passion for good design that extends to the websites and products that I build. One of my favorite passtimes is to experiment with color palletes and layouts until I've created something that I love.</p>
